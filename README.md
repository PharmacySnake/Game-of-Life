# Game of Life
This is a restricted version of the Game of life. What I mean by this is that the playingfield is finite.
When launched the GoL will ask for a width and height for the gameboard.
The width and height must be positive integers.
After your quick personal input, sit, stand or do somersaults and enjoy.
